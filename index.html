								<p>⭐⭐⭐⭐ <br /> <em>Greg James-H:Loved it. Never seen a one piece movie but this was easily one of the top anime movies I've ever seen. It's a musical and colorful overload. Even if you're not a one piece fan you'll still probably enjoy it. Ado did a great job with the music</strong></p>

She revives Little Women as a coming-of-age movie, a marriage comedy, a sibling-rivalry drama – and perhaps most interestingly of all, an autofictional manifesto for writing your own life."</em>

								<p>⭐⭐⭐⭐<br /> <em>El Nathan Daylusan:I would say this is TIMELESS.It's also good and tells you that reading books can make you smart.Thanks netflix! It is also nice and a happy ending at the end! At first she has parents that think reading is dumb and watching TV is better.But when Matilda keeps reading she destroys the TV set with something ( I didn't want to say powers) also,she has a mean principal that is agrees to the deal the dad said,but Her teacher is really nice and becomes the principal at the end.</em>
